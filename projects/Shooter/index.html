                    <p>
                    I challenged myself to make a implement WebSocket-like feature from basics with Java api (Socket and Thread).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A few months back I had read the legendary book "Head First Java" and learned about Sockets and Threads in Chapter 15. On top of that
                    I had previous experience with SFML's Graphics api. So I decided to implement a multiplayer game. I had never worked with SFML's Networking
                    api. So it was an opportunity to learn that too.

                        <img class="img-fluid" src="images/multiplayer.png" alt="...">
                    </div>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The game is very simple. First there is this <a href="https://github.com/best-rion/ServerForMultiplayerShooter">server</a> which must be running.
                    Players can run the excutable and enter server's IP address in the console input and the press enter. And boom! Here you are on the screen with 
                    your friends. Shoot the other players and try not to get shot.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    In the server each player got their own thread with a socket connection. And there is a single separate thread for broadcasting player positions
                    to all the players.
                    </p>
