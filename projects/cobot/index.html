                    I chose engineering to do exactly this kind of stuff. Engineering should not be just about memorizing formulas and solving made up questions in exams.
                    We engineering students should get the opportunity to build real world applications. Though we have the option to build things on our own, in practice
                    it is very difficult to make a hardware project alone. We need help and cooperation. I got such an opportunity during my 
                    5<sup><small>th</small></sup> semester. Luckily my friends (best-friends) were in the same group. And I enjoyed doing jokes with them while working on the project.

                    In Mechanical Engineering department we have to complete this sessional course ME 366 (Electro-Mechanical System Design and Practice). To complete this course
                    students are divided into groups of 4. Each group is assigned a project. In our case it was a Trash Collecting bot project. So basically what we had to make was a robot - 
                    that can collect trash on its own, without human help. Sounds simple, right? Well, No! Let's break down the tasks. The robot has to see an object; detect whether it is a trash or not
                    or what kind of trash it is; move towards the trash; grab it with it's robotic arm and place that trash in its container. So we had to do all kinds of engineering stuff

                        <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&q=arduino">Arduino</a>,

                        <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ultrasonic+sensor">Ultrasonic sensor</a>  - we used these components). We had to 3D-print the arm of our robot.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                    Having past experience in programming with Python I got the responsibility for the Trash-Detection part. My job was to train an AI model to
                    detect 3 Objects (Bottle, Paper and Can) and detect them using ESP32 CAM. I used 
                    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=YOLOv8">YOLOv8</a>, to train the model with photos of bottle, paper and can; and used a few funtions of
                    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=OpenCV">OpenCV</a> to detect the trash. I had to do a lot of learning and tinkering. And I did it! AND my friends also did their job as well and at the end we were successful in making
                    such a robot that can detect trash and collect it. We did not give our 100% as it was just a 1.5 credit course. I think the credit for such an educative course should have been higher; And universities
                    should add more such courses for students to learn the true essence of engineering. There is no financial loss in it for the university anyway. The students pay for the equipments from their own pocket. But the experience is worth every penny.
